class_name DogFacade
extends DogComponent
## Base class for facade components.
##
## The Facade orchestrates multiple components and exposes a
## single, flattened [code]@export[/code] surface for them.
##
## This centralizes and simplifies the interface of components
## that converge with one another. It prevents polluting
## the host/owner tree with dozens of exposed nodes.
## after _ready():
## [codeblock]
## @export var max_jumps: int = 1:
##     set(value):
##         max_jumps = value
##         _jump.max_jumps = value
##
## var _jump: JumpComponent = JumpComponent.new()
## [/codeblock]
## [b]Note:[/b] don't use @onready for component vars, the var must
## exist before the @export setter runs, and @onready only resolves
## after _ready():
